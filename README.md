##Test task for Darqube

Everything is done in accordance with your wishes.

The front-end part of the project has not been completed yet (it is necessary to complete the logic with the registration and login of the user, as well as part of the display of streams according to the subscription)

I used a multistep dockerfile as using docker compose is not rational due to the small size of the project.
